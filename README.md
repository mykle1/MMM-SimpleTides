## MMM-SimpleTides

A simple tide module.

## S.O.P.

As usual, this module was not made to compete with any others. I make simple modules
because I enjoy doing it. I try to keep them small so that they don't use too much
screen real estate. My hope is that they are all informative, or fun, or both.

## What you get

* A rotation of tides for the next 7 days
* Day, date and time for each tide
* High tide or Low tide with icon indicator
* Height variance of tide in feet or meters
* Name of the location of the tide station
* Tide station used is the closest to your longitude and latitude
* The actual longitude and latitude of tide station being used

## Examples

Annotated .css file included for position, sizing, and coloring. Default is white.

* One colored with header, one plain white with no header.
